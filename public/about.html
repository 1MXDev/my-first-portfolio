<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Abubakar Mohamed Ali, a Computer Science student at the Institute of Finance Management (IFM)
  in Tanzania. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology shapes the world around us, and that curiosity led me 
  to pursue a path in computing. From a young age, I developed an interest in digital tools and how websites work. 
  Now, I’m focused on building a strong foundation in programming, system analysis, and web development. 
  My long-term goal is to become a skilled software engineer and a successful tech entrepreneur who builds 
  digital products that solve real problems for people in my community and beyond.</p>

<p>As part of my learning journey, I’ve spent time practicing HTML, CSS, and other web technologies, 
  and I’m constantly exploring new tools and frameworks that can make me more efficient as a developer. 
  Although I’m still growing, I’ve learned the importance of consistency, problem-solving, and continuous improvement.
  One of my dreams is to become a freelance web developer who can create websites and applications for clients
  around the world. I believe in learning by doing, so I enjoy creating small projects and testing different design 
  ideas to sharpen my skills. I'm also working on creating a personal portfolio website that will showcase my projects,
  skills, and future work as I continue to grow professionally.</p>

<p>In addition to my tech interests, I have experience in the hospitality industry, where I worked as a chef at Tembo
House Hotel. That role taught me a lot about discipline, time management, and working under pressure. I also have a
business mindset, and I’m currently involved in selling computers to fellow students through creative payment plans.
I believe that combining technology with business can open many doors and make life easier for others. Whether it’s 
helping students access affordable PCs or designing websites for small businesses, I’m always looking for ways to
provide value. Outside of school and work, I enjoy learning about investments, exploring new tech trends, 
and connecting with other ambitious young people who share the same vision for a better future through technology.</p>
